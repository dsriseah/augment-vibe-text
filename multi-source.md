## What USED to be important back in 2017

In 2017, my idea of productivity was still based on process and finding ideal opportunities for collaboration. I recognized that I needed external collaborators to be productive, so I looked for "fit" in terms of shared interest and level of commitment while trying to maintain momentum on my own. Energy management was a concern, and I believed that energy could be found if I found my "tribe" of like-minded people.

- **TECH** - General programming acumen, web site development, interactive design, information graphic design
- **PROCESS** - Ways to do things, writing for continuity
- **DESIGN** - As a high-level offering focused on concepts over styling and ornamentation
- **DOCUMENTATION** - Conceptual model-based approach, functional grouping of information, explanation of principles over recipes.
- **WRITING** - As my main thinking process across all domains: graphics, design, programming, etc.
- **CREATIVE INDEPENDENCE** - The means to spend the bulk of my time investigating projectsgartenqwdqdqwddqwdqdqw that interest me that also generate sustaining income.
- **EXPLORE/LEARN/BUILD/SHARE** - The way that I naturally develop projects so they produce beneficial artifacts that can be held in the hand or experienced first-hand.
- **MASTERY** - Getting really good at what I do and deliver, defining practices and principles that deliver outstanding excellence. This includes a commitment to developing one's sense of mastery.
- **COLLABORATION** - Finding like-minded people to work with closely, as I had in the past.
- **THE TRIBE** - The imagined ideal group of collaborators: people who are positive-minded, self-empowered, curious, conscientious, competent, generous, and kind people who enjoy sharing knowledge and work experiences.
- **IDENTITY** - Figuring out how to package myself so other people could understand who I was, what I did, and why I did it.
- **COMMUNITY** - Figuring out the best way I could "fit" my interests with existing groups and organizations, or frame what I did in terms that met their needs as well as mine.

## What has SHIFTED in 2025

In 2025, I decided to try grounding productivity in **values** instead, recognizing that I was **emotionally driven** more than I thought. I shifted my self image as "unrelatable and weird" to having "an unusual cognitive architecture" with very different drives than the average person.

- **VALUES-FIRST** - In 2025, I declared that **authenticity**, **transparency**, and **curiosity** were aspects of the kind of **truth** I wished to embody. In terms of structure, authenticity is "truth to myself", transparency is "truth in representing myself", and curiosity is "discovering truths". This replaces PRODUCTIVITY-FIRST approaches that most people follow. The theory is that when I was out of alignment with my values in working situations, my energy suffered greatly. The following entries form the complicated matrix of what I have to successful embody...and it's a lot!
- **GENDER TRANSITION** - I began social gender transition in 2017, figuring out how it impacted what I thought was important and what was different. In 2025, I now have gender identity as **non-binary trans-feminine** but it is only the third-most important aspect of my identity.
- **NEURODIVERGENT EXPLORATION** - Clinically diagnosed with ADHD and ASD in 2023. Accepted neurodivergent traits as outside of clinical definition in 2025. I am a cross-domain synthesizing system thinker with dominant emotional processing. Special interest is individual-first literate design expressed as a humane--not human-centered--approach to design. My preferred approach to life is that of a **architect-builder** that employs system thinking to effectively service emotional needs for others beyond mere technical solutions. My data analysis style is find non-obvious concordance across multiple knowledge domains and models to synthesize a unique solution.
- **NARRATIVE APPROACH** - I find it easier to follow stories than boring rules, because stories have character motivation and growth in the face of interesting challenges. The **world building** that goes with narrative expression is foundational to both design and communication, unsurprisingly. It's important to me to express myself using narrative techniques despite my systems thinking logical core (which again, is always in support to the emotional core's desire)
- **HIGH INTENSITY** / **HIGH BANDWIDTH CONVERSATION** - Given my nature of a cross-domain synthesizer, I have a tremendous capacity for recieving and sharing information with others in a very deliberate manner. Recognizing that this is not how most people communicate, I evolved a set of rules for transforming this communciation style into a more universal form. In 2025 I dubbed this "90% Sentiment-First Communication" (90S) as shorthand to remember how it works, and as an alternative to masking for other people's comfort.
- **ALL THE ANIMALS ARE FRIENDS** / **"THE MEADOW"** - The desire of my emotional core is simply that everyone can express their true self and get along, ideally working together to create the reality that is in their imagination in a safe, sustaining environment. This is like the plot of a cozy children's cartoon, but it is fundamentally what my heart desires. Applying my systematic logical core to overcome the ugly realities of the world to achieve this **sanctuary** is the transformation of CREATIVE INDEPENDENCE in 2025.
- **ARCHITECTS & BUILDERS** / **"THE COLONY"** - The COLLABORATION aspect of 2017 is made more concrete by proposing a **colony structure** that provides for the needs of ALL THE ANIMALS ARE FRIENDS. The hardened realist of my systemizing approach to organizational development is interested in how to **govern** such a place by declaring self-proving **principles** and defining **cultural norms** that back them up. While many people would want to be part of a colony, not everyone knows how to act or how to architect or build such a place.
- **SRI-NESS** - While there is a LOT going on in my head, it's **not** necessary to communicate it all. My sense of self or "Sri-ness" is comprised of everything above and I can articulate it very well, but this is not what people want. People want to feel seen, connected, and appreciated. It's not that I'm unrelatable and weird. I was just overwhelming everyone. Sri is an **Architect-Builder**. Sri wants **All the Animals to be Friends**. Sri wants people to **find their sanctuary** and **be themselves**. As a result, Sri is willing to share knowledge and help out when she can, because that's the baseline requirement for community. For friendship, following the values of authenticity, transparency, and curiosity as one's personal expression of truth is the aspirational goal for everyone in the community.
- **MAGICAL ADVENTURE CAT** - To repackage the complexity of Sri-ness, I'm using a narrative approach based on being a "magical adventure cat". This is a tidy packaging of all the complexity into a more approachable form. "Magic" is shorthand for the complexity of my thought processes that make sense only to me. "Adventure" is shorthand for my experimental "explore-learn-build-share" approach to making things, and of course "Cat" is culturally accepted as "weird and unfathomable but still delightful". While I wouldn't _introduce_ myself as a magical adventure cat, both my logical and emotional sides nicely encapsulated into a simpler sense of self.

## New Chapters

These are the new chapters that beckon given the above:

- **Return to blogging** on the **fediverse** as a main activity to drive collaboration on the **Open Social Web**. There are a ton of anti-humane forces that are enshittifying our lives. I want to connect my colony of values/interested with compatible entities so we can do something about it, and the Fediverse is the best bet I see for this.
- **Develop Products for 90S Consumption** is just me letting go of the idea that "everything I am doing has to be deeply understood". Let people pick stuff they just like, also because they like buying stuff from the secret Magical Adventure Cat who pulls these weird things out of somewhere.
- **Be Present in Local Community** is me patroling the community as a "friendly cat" to express the positive qualities of Sri-ness with the people around me. Free of the need to "explain", I can focus on being "present and interested" with everyone I meet. The 90S insights from overseas trip to Taiwan and being cheerful to people around me goes a long way toward establishing positive precedent!

## The Sri Collaboration Stack

This is a compact list of things that are on my mind, used to frame my actions in context of creating The Colony and The Meadow.

### CORE DIRECTIVES

- Lead with emotion as decision-making metric
- Vet emotional decisions with logic
- Sri-ness is the expression of own sense of Authenticity, Transparency, and Curiosity in service of Trust

### COMMUNITY EXPRESSION

- The Meadow - where "all the animals are friends", with a strong culture of expression of own values and trust, where one can find the support for turning their dreams into reality. This is a cozy space that everyone learns to maintain with each other.
- The Colony - the governing structure and related facilities for creating a sustaining culture of collaboration that benefits everyone. Comprised of several tribes-people with roles such as architect, builder, supporter, creators, allies, and consumers. The key roles for governance are architect and builder, with supporters providing necessary feedback. Creators are drawn to the space for their own need. Allies are not participants but speak well of the space. Consumers are those who do not buy into the vision, but recognize a good quality market when they see it.

### DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES

- Leadership through Communication by Example
- Inclusion through Social Contract and Cultural Engineering
- Practice of Authenticity, Transparency, and Curiosity on the institutional level
- Defining practice of Inclusion free of toxicity
- Meadow and Colony Mission/Vision Statements
- Make Governing Processes and Conventions
- Define Economic and Growth Metrics
- Articulation of Cultural Values and Mission Relevance
- Articulation of Anti-Values to help detect governance corruption
- Creation of a Seed Packet for other people to read and adapt their own version of The Colony.

**August 8 Critical Points - Narrative Summary:**

• **Life Chapter Closure**: Major transitions ending (work contracts, therapy) while preparing to return to independent creative work after a decade

• **Communication Breakthrough**: Developed systematic method to translate her complex thinking into accessible, sentiment-based communication without losing authenticity

• **Values Crystallization**: Solidified core operational values (Authenticity/Transparency/Curiosity) as non-negotiable foundation rather than aspirational goals

• **Community Strategy Shift**: Moved from seeking cognitive twins to attracting values-aligned collaborators through demonstration rather than explanation

• **Technical Foundation**: Prioritized rebuilding her digital platform as the practical infrastructure for all other goals

• **Mission Integration**: Unified her technical expertise with human-centered community building into coherent professional identity

**August 16 Brain Dump - Narrative Summary:**

• **Framework Integration**: All separate theoretical developments (90S communication, Meadow/Colony, Sri-kin taxonomy, moral architecture) now form a unified, implementable system

• **Identity Packaging Complete**: "Magical Adventure Cat" successfully encapsulates her complexity into accessible form while maintaining authenticity

• **Operational Architecture**: Meadow (cultural sanctuary) and Colony (productive infrastructure) with defined roles create systematic community scaling approach

• **Meta-Design Achievement**: Solved the fundamental challenge of remaining authentic while being accessible through "steganographic depth" - sophisticated ideas embedded in 90S-digestible content

• **Implementation Readiness**: Moved from theoretical frameworks to concrete action plans with three defined "New Chapters" (blogging return, product development, local community presence)

• **Values Operationalization**: Core values now function as practical governance principles rather than abstract ideals, with specific anti-values defined to detect corruption
